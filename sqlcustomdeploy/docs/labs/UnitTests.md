The build fails because the connection string is your localdb. This will need to be updated for your Azure database in the app.config. 

>Right-click on the project > **SQL Server Test Configuration** > Select Azure Connection. 

[More to Come] Remember the Firewall settings and re-deploy the database for modifications.
