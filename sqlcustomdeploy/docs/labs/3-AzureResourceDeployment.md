### Purpose
This lab is to build your foundational knowledge of how to leverage Azure DevOps to deploy Azure Resource with CI/CD pipelines.  This lab walks you through advanced ARM templates showing you how you can have an end state configuration for your Azure resource to limit the need to do post deployment configuration. You will create both a build and release pipeline which covers the CI/CD portions of DevOps.

### Launch VS Code

1. Open **sql_db.json** file
   1. Located in: **Deployments** > **ARM** > **templates**</br>

![](./imgs/sql_db.png)

1. Review lines **180 - 196** there are multiple example of how you can use functions in ARM templates to control behavior and maybe your deployments dynamic.
2. Review lines **376** - **410**, these resources are examples of how you can create multiple Firewall Range rules and/or vNet Firewall rules using copy index and a parameter array
3. Review lines **411** & **486** this is an example of how to use copy index to deploy multiple databases with the option of different SKUs for each DB  

   1. Also note that this resource uses a nested resource to perform some other configurations on each database like: ensure TDE is enabled, auditing is configured, and Security Alert Policies are set
   
4. This ARM template can be used to be deploy: Storage account, Log Analytics, SQL Logical Server, and multiple SQL DB(s). </br>

:bulb: You may see older schema versions this is because the template is designed to work in both Azure Commercial and Azure Government

5. Close **sql_db.json** without saving anything

#### Edit parameter file

1. Open **sql_db.parameter.dev.json** file
    1. Located in: **Deployments** > **ARM** > **parameter** </br>

![](./imgs/parameters.png)

1. Before making any changes to the parameter file spend some time reviewing it and reading through all of the comments.
   1. Each parameter has comments to help provide you with context of the value needed
   2. For this workshop you will only need to updated the values we call out, but are free to test other values outside of the workshop.

2. Enter name for **serverName**, line **27**
   1. The server name needs to be globally unique
   2. Recommend using: **{alias}-sqlsrv-dev** (ie jdoe-sqlsrv-dev) </br>

![](./imgs/srvName.png)

4. Enter values for **serverADAdminGroup** at line **29** and **serverADAdminSID** at line **39**

:bulb: You can look up these values in Azure AD > Users > Select the User </br>

![](./imgs/serverAdmin.png) </br>

![](./imgs/parmAdmin.png)</br>

1. Enter **emailAddress** at line **162**

:exclamation: Email address for where you want Security Alerts and Vulnerability Assessment scans sent.

![](./imgs/email.png)

1. Save and close **sql_db.parameter.dev.json** file

#### Test deployment with PowerShell

1. Click **File** > **New File** or keyboard shortcut: *Ctrl + N*
2. Set File format to PowerShell

```PowerShell
param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$ARMOutput
    )

#region Convert from json
$json = $ARMOutput | convertfrom-json
$sqlAdminLogin = $json.administratorLogin.value
$sqlAdminPass = $json.administratorLoginPassword.value
#endregion

#region Parse ARM Template Output
Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sql.Login]$sqlAdminLogin"
Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sql.Pass;issecret=true]$sqlAdminPass"
#endregion

```

```PowerShell

Param(
	$kVaultName,
	$ResourceGroup,	
	$adminLogin,
    $adminPass
    )

Function ToSecret {
	Param($val)
	$secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $val -AsPlainText -Force
	$secret 
	}

$kvSecrets = @{
	'SQLadminLogin' = ToSecret -val $adminLogin
	'SQLadminPass' = ToSecret -val $adminPass
}

ForEach($Key in $kvSecrets.Keys){
	$response = Set-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $kVaultName -Name $Key -SecretValue $kvSecrets[$Key]
	Write-Host $response
    }
    
```
:bulb:The code above may not work in LOD. Use the below:
```
-keyVaultName "$(keyvault.VaultName)-$(rEnv)" -location "$(location)" -sku "Standard" -accessPolicies [{"objectId":"$(sp.ObjectId)","tenantId":"$(sp.tenantId)","metadata":{"description":"Service Principal - DevOps-DLM"},"permissions":{"keys":["Get","List","Update","Create","Import","Delete","Recover","Backup","Restore"],"secrets":["Get","List","Set","Delete","Recover","Backup","Restore"],"certificates":["Get","List","Update","Create","Import","Delete","Recover","ManageContacts","ManageIssuers","GetIssuers","ListIssuers","SetIssuers","DeleteIssuers"],"storage":["Get","List","Update","Set","Delete","Regeneratekey","Recover","Backup","Restore"]}}] -tenant "$(sp.tenantId)" -enabledForDeployment false -enabledForTemplateDeployment true -enabledForDiskEncryption false
```
   7. Enter the **Script Arguments**:

```
 -kVaultName "$(keyvault.VaultName)-$(rEnv)"
 -ResourceGroup $(ResourceGroup)$(rEnv)
 -adminLogin $(sql.Login)
 -adminPass $(sql.Pass)
```

![](./imgs/cd-release.png)

22. If you get a popup window about the new improvement to the release summary page feel free to close or review for more information
23. Notice that in **Stages** it says **Not deployed** this is because it was manually triggered 
24. Hover over **Dev: Az Resource Dep** to expose the **Deploy** button > Click it

![](./imgs/cd-deploy.png)

25. Comment is optional > Click **Deploy**
26. Click on **In progress** to view status of deployment
    1.  You can also navigate to your resource group in Azure and view status of the deployment on the Deployments blade

:exclamation: If you receive a "MissingSubscriptionRegistration" error, register the Key Vault provider in **Subscription** > **{Your Subscription}** > **Resource Providers** > Search for **KeyVault** > **Register**

:exclamation:  If you want to clear your Resource Group during this **dev** stage set the **clearResources** variable to **yes**. Since this would meet the custom condition you will be deploying an "empty" template in Complete mode. Which will clear out your resource group (delete all resources not in your template).  This can take a bit of time and even timeout to complete.  While you are waiting for your Release to complete, review the logs as it deploys, or feel free to move on with the next steps in this lab. Don't forget to check status and address any errors.

**Expected Results**:

![](./imgs/cd-result1.png)

![](./imgs/cd-result2.png)

:bulb: At this point in the workshop you have successfully created a full CI/CD dev pipeline which can be used to develop and deploy Azure Resources. If you make changes to your ARM templates or parameter files located in the *Deployment* directory and push the changes to your remote Azure DevOps repository your build and release will happen automatically.  This keeps you and your development team from having to make changes via the portal.  You now have the ability to collaborate and perform rapid development with change logged via Git, and the ability to roll back / roll forward as needed.

## <div style="color: #107c10">Exercise - Configure Prod CI/CD Pipelines</div>

:bulb: In this exercise you will walk through the steps to configure your production release pipelines both CI and CD.  Your prod release pipeline will use the code from your master branch to deploy to your dev resource group, include a gate that requires approval to deploy to your prod resource group, and can only be run via changes to your **master** branch from **pull requests**. 

### Create & configure Prod build pipeline (CI)

1. In your Azure DevOps project navigate to **Pipelines** > **Pipelines**
2. Click on your pipeline **Dev - Azure Resources-CI**
3. Click on the ellipses in the top right corner next to the Run pipeline button

![](./imgs/pr-complete.png)

   9. Click the **Complete merge** button

5. At this point you have completed the steps to perform a **Pull Request**

### Review Prod CI/CD

1. Navigate to **Pipelines** > **Pipelines**
2. You will now see both you Prod and Dev Pipelines
   1. Click into Prod to review the status of your build and the logs
3. Navigate to **Pipelines** > **Releases**
   1. You should see both your dev and prod Release pipelines
      1. If you do not see your prod it could be because your build is not completed and triggered your release. 
   2. Click into your Prod release pipeline to review status and logs
   3. Notice that once your Dev Stage completes you will need to approve the deployment into prod.

![](./imgs/prod-release1.png)

4. Navigate to Azure via the portal and check that all your resources in Resource Group: **SuperchargeSQL-dev** deployed correctly 
5. You should also receive an email to approve the Prod stage of your release that looks similar to this:
